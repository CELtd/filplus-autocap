# Fil+ Programmable Allocator Possible Smart Contract Architecture

This document outlines a possible modular smart contract architecture for a Programmable Datacap Allocator on Filecoin. Each component plays a distinct role in facilitating secure and programmable datacap distribution via auctions.

---
## Overview
### Key components
- **`RevenueWallet`**: Multisig wallet that receives FIL from Storage Providers (SPs).
- **`DatacapWallet`**: Multisig wallet holding datacap provided by root key holders.
- **`ProtocolWallet`**: Wallet controlled by the protocol; receives a portion of the fees from each auction.
- **`VerifiedSPList`**: Verifies and registers eligible SPs through zero-FIL transactions.
- **`MasterBot`**: Coordinates auction rounds every 24 hours (triggered externally by **Gelato Web3 Functions**). Gathers auction data from RevenueBot, calculates rewards, fees, and initiates execution of transactions via multisig wallets.
- **`RevenueBot`**: Monitors the RevenueWallet for incoming SP contributions. Verifies SPs against VerifiedSPList. Maintains auctionInfo state containing declared revenues by SPs. Crafts and signs refund transactions from the RevenueWallet.
- **`DatacapBot`**: Tracks available datacap in DatacapWallet. Crafts and signs datacap reward transactions.

### Global Workflow
1. A Storage Provider (SP) registers via `VerifiedSPList`.
2. SP sends a revenue declaration tx in FIL to `RevenueWallet`.
3. `RevenueWallet` signals `RevenueBot`, which:
    -  Checks if the sender is a verified SP by querying `VerifiedSPList`;
    -  Stores the SP contribution (address, FIL) in `auctionInfo`.
5. External Automation (e.g., [Gelato Web3 Functions](https://docs.gelato.network/web3-services/web3-functions)) triggers `MasterBot.clearAuction` e.g. every 24 hours.
8. At each trigger, `MasterBot`:
    - Checks if sufficient datacap is available in `DatacapWallet` via `DatacapBot`;
    - Collects the current auction state from `RevenueBot` obtaining SP addresses and declared deal revenues;
    - Computes Datacap to be issued per SP based on relative contribution;
    - Computes the refund in FIL that need to be issued to each SP;
    - Computes the fee amount that has to be burned and the fee amount that has to be sent to `ProtocolWallet`;
    - Instructs `RevenueBot` and `DatacapBot` to craft and sign the transactions providing them SP adresses with associated FIL refund and datacap rewards.
11. `DatacapBot` and `RevenueBot` prepare and sign transactions.
12. `MasterBot` checks, signs and executes them via the multisig wallets.
13. Rewards are distributed; protocol fee goes to `ProtocolWallet`; remaining fee burned.

### Optional Offchain Application (Frontend)
An optional offchain application may be provided to offer visibility into the system:
- Displays current auction pool state (`auctionInfo` from `RevenueBot`);
- Shows countdown to the next auction round (e.g. based on last round timestamp + 24h);
- Allows SPs to assess whether it is strategic to declare their revenue at a given moment.

### Timing and Automation
The system could rely on  [Gelato Web3 Functions](https://docs.gelato.network/web3-services/web3-functions) to: 
- Trigger `MasterBot.clearAuction` on a daily schedule (e.g., every 24h);
- Ensure fully automated and trust-minimized operation.
- This decouples SP participation from the auction clearing logic and ensures a predictable rhythm of datacap distribution.

## Components
### ðŸ’° DatacapWallet
**Type:** Smart contract multisig wallet 
**Purpose:** Custodian of datacap tokens to be distributed to SPs after each auction round

#### Key Characteristics:
- Holds datacap tokens.
- Requires two signatures for outgoing transfers:
  - `DatacapBot`;
  - `MasterBot`.
- Exposes balance to `DatacapBot` for availability checks.

#### Core Functions:
```solidity
function getBalance() external view returns (uint256);
  // Returns current datacap token balance held in the wallet.

function proposeTransaction(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (uint256);
  // Creates a new transaction proposal to transfer datacap.

function approveTransaction(uint256 txId) external;
  // Signs approval for a previously proposed transaction.

function executeTransaction(uint256 txId) external;
  // Executes a transaction after the required number of approvals.
```

#### Workflow:
1. `DatacapBot` proposes a transfer.
2. `MasterBot` approves and executes it.

### ðŸ’° RevenueWallet
**Type:** Smart contract multisig wallet  
**Purpose:** Receives FIL contributions from SPs and issues refunds post-auction

#### Key Characteristics:
- Receives FIL from Storage Providers.
- Requires two signatures for outgoing transfers:
  - `RevenueBot`;
  - `MasterBot`.
- Notifies `RevenueBot` upon receiving new contributions.

#### Core Functions:
```solidity
function receiveContribution(address sp) external payable;
  // Receives FIL contribution and notifies RevenueBot.
  
function proposeTransaction(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (uint256);
  // Creates a new transaction proposal to refund FIL after auction completion.

function approveTransaction(uint256 txId) external;
  // Signs approval for the refund transaction.

function executeTransaction(uint256 txId) external;
  // Executes the transaction after required approvals.
```

#### Workflow:
1. SP sends FIL to `RevenueWallet`.
2. `RevenueWallet` notifies `RevenueBot` that a contribution has been made.
3. `RevenueBot` proposes a transfer.
4. `MasterBot` approves and executes it.

### ðŸ’¼ ProtocolWallet
