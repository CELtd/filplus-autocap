# FIL+ Autocap
> ðŸš§ **Note**: This is a work-in-progress MVP.

**FIL+ Autocap** is a programmable allocator for [Filecoin Plus (FIL+)](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus), designed to automatically distribute datacap to Storage Providers (SPs) based on on-chain deal revenue, without human intervention.

This approach rewards SPs who generate real paid deals and helps reduce reliance on manual verification, improving both transparency and scalability.

## Motivation

The current FIL+ system requires human oversight and often favors retrievable, open data, creating barriers for real-world clients with private or confidential data.

**FIL+ Autocap** aims to:

- **Eliminate human subjectivity** from the datacap allocation process  
- **Enable permissionless participation** via an economic incentive model
