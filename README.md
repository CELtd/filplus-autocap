# FIL+ Autocap

**FIL+ Autocap** is a programmable allocator for [Filecoin Plus (FIL+)](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus), designed to automatically distribute datacap to Storage Providers (SPs) based on on-chain deal revenue ‚Äî without human intervention.

This approach rewards SPs who generate real paid deals and helps reduce reliance on manual verification, improving both transparency and scalability.

---

## Motivation

The current FIL+ system requires human oversight and often favors retrievable, open data ‚Äî creating barriers for real-world clients with private or confidential data.

**FIL+ Autocap** aims to:

- **Eliminate human subjectivity** from the datacap allocation process  
- **Encourage real demand** by rewarding SPs with paying clients  
- **Enable permissionless participation** via an economic incentive model

---

## Core Idea

The allocator runs in discrete time rounds and distributes datacap proportionally to the **reported on-chain deal revenue** by each SP.

### Key Features

- **Revenue-based rewards** ‚Äî More deal revenue ‚Üí more datacap  
- **Competition-based mechanism** ‚Äî SPs compete for a fixed datacap pool  
- **Fee burn to resist wash trading** ‚Äî A fraction of revenue is burnt to add cost to fake deals

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/filplus-autocap.git
cd filplus-autocap

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

---

## How It Works

Once installed, you can start a test auction using the built-in CLI interface:

```bash
poetry run test-auction
```

This command starts the `MasterBot`, which triggers periodic auction rounds based on the settings in `config/setup.json`.

While the system runs, you'll interact with it via terminal commands:

```text
Enter command (register, declare, exit):
```

### Commands

#### `register`

Registers a new Storage Provider (SP) to the system.

You'll be prompted to provide:

- SP address  
- Owner address  
- Initial FIL balance

Example:
```text
Enter command (register, declare, exit): register
Enter SP address: sp1
Enter SP owner: sp1
Enter SP FIL balance: 100
```

The SP is then added to `data/verified_sp_list.json`.

#### `declare`

Used to declare deal revenue sent by a known SP to the protocol:

```text
Enter command (register, declare, exit): declare
Enter SP address: sp1
Enter revenue amount (FIL): 10
```

This will simulate a transaction from the SP to the protocol wallet, and the revenue will be considered in the next auction round.

#### `exit`

Stops the program.

## Auction Rounds

The `MasterBot` executes auction rounds at regular intervals. These parameters are configured in:

- `config/setup.json`:
  - `auction_duration`: Duration of a tick in seconds
  - `auction_fee`: Percentage of declared revenue to burn
  - `datacap_per_round`: Datacap to distribute each round

Auction execution is fully logged in `data/masterbot.log`. The log includes:

- Epoch ticks
- SP registration events
- Declared transactions
- Auction rounds (start, state, final allocation)
